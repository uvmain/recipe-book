  "ingredients": "- 375g ready-rolled puff pastry\n- Dijon mustard\n- 120g fontina or Gruyere\n- 90g prosciutto crudo, sliced on the thick side\n- Olive oll\n- Grated Parmesan\n",
  "instructions": "- Cut the pastry in half and roll one piece really thinly into a rectangle approximately 40 x 30cm. Cut the pastry in two long rectangles.\n- Spread each one with a little mustard — about two heaped teaspoons each.\n- Slice half the cheese thinly and cover one half of each pastry rectangle with it, leaving a gap round the edge. On top of that place pieces of the ham, leaving enough for the second piece of pastry.\n- Brush the edges of the pastry with olive oil, then fold the bare halves over the cheese and ham, pressing the edges down to seal. You should have two thin, squarish parcels.\n- Transfer these to a baking sheet and repeat with the second half of pastry. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.\n- Remove the pastries from the fridge, brush them with oil and dust with Parmesan. Bake in an oven preheated to 225°C/Gas 7 for 10-12 minutes, till slightly risen.\n- Check that the Underside is crisp; if not, carefully turn the pastries over and cook for a few minutes longer.",
