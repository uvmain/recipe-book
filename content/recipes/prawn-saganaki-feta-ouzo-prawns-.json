  "instructions": "- Shell and de-gut the prawns, keeping half of the heads to one side and marinating the rest in 40ml of the ouzo.\n- Heat the olive oil in a wide pan on a low-medium heat and add the leeks, spring onions, peppers, chili flakes, star anise. Sauté for 2 minutes and then add the prawn heads and leave to simmer for about 10 minutes or until the vegetables have softened and sweetened.\n- Tip the chopped tomatoes and mini pommodori or cherry tomatoes into the pan and simmer until the liquid has reduced (about 5 minutes).\n- Add the slices of feta, turning them over after about 2 minutes before they start melting.\n- Once the feta slices have been turned over, add all the prawns with their ouzo marinade and cook for 2 minutes on the first side, turn over, leave to simmer for 1 minute and then pour in the rest of the ouzo. You can flambé the pan at this point if you like. Then, remove from the heat, sprinkle the chopped fresh coriander leaves over and season sparingly.",
