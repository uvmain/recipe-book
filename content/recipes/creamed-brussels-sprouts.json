  "ingredients": "- 2 rashers streaky bacon\n- 30g butter\n- 220g Brussels sprouts, washed and finely shredded\n- 1 clove garlic, finely chopped\n- 1 tbsp chopped parsley\n- 80ml double cream\n- Squeeze of lemon juice\n- Handful of grated parmesan",
  "instructions": "- Preheat the oven to 220ÂºC.\n- Slice the bacon into thin strips and fry in a small pan until crisp and golden. Tip out onto kitchen paper and keep to one side.\n- Melt the butter in a frying pan or small saucepan and once foaming, tip in the shredded Brussels sprouts (we find that using a mandolin is the most effective way to finely spread the sprouts, however a good knife will work too). Cook over a moderate heat for 2 minutes, stirring frequently, before adding the garlic, parsley and some salt and pepper. Turn the heat down slightly and continue to cook for 8-10 minutes until the sprouts have wilted and softened.\n- Pour in the double cream and turn the heat up until the cream starts to bubble. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the cream has reduced and thickened. Stir the crispy bacon through the mixture, add a little lemon juice to taste and then tip into a small gratin dish.\n- Top with the grated parmesan and bake at the top of the oven for 10 minutes or until the top of the gratin is golden.",
