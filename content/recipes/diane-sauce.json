  "ingredients": "- 2 banana shallots, finely diced\n- 180g button mushrooms, sliced\n- 2 garlic cloves, grated\n- knob of unsalted butter\n- 160ml good brandy or cognac\n- 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce\n- 2 tsp Dijon mustard\n- 300ml double cream\n- 60g fresh flatleaf parsley, finely chopped\n- sea salt and freshly ground black pepper",
  "instructions": "- Fry the shallots in a little oil on a medium heat until they start to soften. Add the mushrooms and cook for 2 minutes before adding the garlic and butter.\n- Once the mushrooms are soft and slightly golden, add the brandy or cognac and carefully set it alight by tilting the pan towards the flame on a gas hob. Alternatively, use a match. CAUTION: Keep your face and hair away from the flames. Do not leave unattended.\n- Once the flames have died down, add the Worcestershire sauce followed by the mustard. Cook the sauce for 90 seconds and then stir in the double cream. Reduce on a medium-high heat until slightly thickened, which should take about 2-3 minutes.\n- Stir in the parsley, taste the sauce, then season with salt and pepper",
