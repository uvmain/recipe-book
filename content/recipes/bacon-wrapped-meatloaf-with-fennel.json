  "instructions": "<ul><li><p>Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Trim each fennel bulb and chop into eight wedges then place in a large roasting tray drizzle with oil season with sea salt and black pepper and roast for 30 minutes.</p></li><li><p>Meanwhile peel and dice the onions and carrots place in a large pan with 1 tablespoon of oil on a medium-low heat and cook for 20 minutes stirring occasionally. Pick the herb leaves finely chop half of them and add to the veg pan saving the rest for later.</p></li><li><p>Leave the veg to cool completely then tear in the mozzarella and add the breadcrumbs minced meat mustard eggs and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Scrunch and mix well then shape into a loaf.</p></li><li><p>Make a space in the middle of the fennel tray and sit the meatloaf in the centre. Criss-cross the smoky bacon over the meatloaf drizzle with a little oil then cover the tray with tin foil. Roast for 30 minutes then remove from the oven and discard the foil.</p></li><li><p>Mix the chicken stock jam and tomato purée together in a jug until smooth then pour into the tray. Toss the reserved herbs with a little oil and scatter into the tray then return to the oven for a final 45 minutes or until cooked through. If the juices need thickening at this stage simply put the tray on the hob to reduce for a few minutes until they're the consistency of your liking skimming away any fat from the surface if needed. Serve the meatloaf sweet fennel and juices with mash and seasonal greens.</p></li></ul>"
