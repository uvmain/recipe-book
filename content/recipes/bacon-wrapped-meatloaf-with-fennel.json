  "ingredients": "- 4 medium bulbs of fennel\n- olive oil\n- 2 onions\n- 2 carrots\n- 15g fresh sage\n- 15g fresh rosemary\n- 125g mozzarella cheese\n- 200g sourdough breadcrumbs\n- 1 kg minced pork\n- 1 kg minced beef\n- 2 tsp wholegrain mustard\n- 2 large free-range eggs\n- 12 rashers smoked streaky bacon\n- 500ml chicken stock\n- 2 tbsp blackcurrant jam\n- 1 tbsp sun-dried tomato purée",
  "instructions": "- Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Trim each fennel bulb and chop into eight wedges then place in a large roasting tray drizzle with oil season with sea salt and black pepper and roast for 30 minutes.\n- Meanwhile peel and dice the onions and carrots place in a large pan with 1 tablespoon of oil on a medium-low heat and cook for 20 minutes stirring occasionally. Pick the herb leaves finely chop half of them and add to the veg pan saving the rest for later.\n- Leave the veg to cool completely then tear in the mozzarella and add the breadcrumbs minced meat mustard eggs and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Scrunch and mix well then shape into a loaf.\n- Make a space in the middle of the fennel tray and sit the meatloaf in the centre. Criss-cross the smoky bacon over the meatloaf drizzle with a little oil then cover the tray with tin foil. Roast for 30 minutes then remove from the oven and discard the foil.\n- Mix the chicken stock jam and tomato purée together in a jug until smooth then pour into the tray. Toss the reserved herbs with a little oil and scatter into the tray then return to the oven for a final 45 minutes or until cooked through. If the juices need thickening at this stage simply put the tray on the hob to reduce for a few minutes until they're the consistency of your liking skimming away any fat from the surface if needed. Serve the meatloaf sweet fennel and juices with mash and seasonal greens."
