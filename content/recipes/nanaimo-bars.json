  "ingredients": "Bottom layer\n\n- 3/4 cup butter\n- 1/3 cup sugar\n- 8 tbsp cocoa\n- 2 eggs, beaten\n- 2 1/4 cups graham crumbs\n- 3/4 cup fine or medium unsweetened coconut\n- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts toasted\n \n\nMiddle layer\n\n- 2 1/4 cups icing sugar\n- 1/2 cup custard powder\n- 2/3 cup butter, at room temperature\n- 1 tsp vanilla paste or extract\n- 2 tbsp whipping cream\n \n\nTop layer\n\n- 1 cup chocolate chips\n- 2 tbsp butter",
  "instructions": "Base layer\n- Melt together the butter, sugar and cocoa over low heat.\n- Add the eggs continue to cook, stirring constantly to fully cook the egg to a soft scrambled texture.\n- Add the graham crumbs, coconut and walnuts.\n- Mix together until well combined then, press into the bottom of a parchment paper lined 9x9 inch baking pan.\n \nFilling\n- With an electric mixer, beat together the butter, custard powder and icing sugar until it starts to come together.\n- Add the vanilla paste and whipping cream and beat well until smooth.\n- This frosting should be very stiff but spreadable. ( Much thicker than you would use to frost a cake for example) If you think it's too thick, you may add a few drops of whipping at a time to bring it to the right consistency.\n- Spread evenly over the bottom layer. Chill in the fridge for a couple of hours before adding the chocolate topping.\n \n\nChocolate Topping\n\n- Melt together the chocolate chips and butter over low heat, just until the chocolate is melted, don't over heat it.\n- Spread quickly over the chilled frosted layer. Return to the fridge until the chocolate sets.\n- Cut into squares or bars. These freeze very well.",
