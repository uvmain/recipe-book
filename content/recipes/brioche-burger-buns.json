  "ingredients": "- 500g strong white flour\n- 50g caster sugar\n- 4 large eggs\n- 4 tsp water\n- 1 tsp salt\n- 3 tsp fast action yeast\n- 250g softened butter\n- 1 egg beaten for egg wash",
  "instructions": "Place all the ingredients into a bowl.\n\nFit the beater blade to the stand mixer.\n\nTurn on the mixer and get it beating the dough together – let it mix for 5 minutes.\n\nAfter 5 minutes beating the dough will be starting to look much more like a dough.\n\nScrape the dough down into a rough ball at the bottom of the bowl and change the beater for the dough hook.\n\nNow let the machine knead the dough (on a low setting 2-3) for 10 minutes.\n\nSo now the dough should be lovely and smooth.\n\nTransfer it to a large bowl, cover and allow to stand at room temp for 1 hour.\n\nAfter 1 hour, place the bowl into the fridge to chill for a further 2 hours. This bit is important – it chills the dough to a cold clay like texture so that you can shape it easily.\n\nSo nicely chilled and firm, time to split the dough into 8 equal portions – approx 128g each.\n\nFlatten each portion of dough out, gather the edges into the middle and then flip the ball over. Using a caged hand over the top of the ball with your fingers touching the worksurface move your hand in a clockwise circle to neaten the ball shape.\n\nSet them all onto a lined or well greased baking tray\n\nCover them loosely with a sheet of clingfilm and let them rise until nearly doubled in size.\n\nThis does take a while 2-3 hours at normal room temp, longer if its cold. The dough is cold from the fridge and needs to come up to room temp before it will start rising. Be patient and if your dough won’t get going move it to a warmer spot, a sunny window ledge should do the trick.\n\nNow preheat the oven to 160c (fan)/180c/Gas Mark 4.\n\nWhen the buns are ready for the oven double brush them with egg wash for a lovely golden finish.\n\nBake in the oven for 22 minutes.\n\nRemove and allow to cool on a wire rack."
