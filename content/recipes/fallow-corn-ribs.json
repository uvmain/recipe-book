Put in the oven for 10 mins or until completely dry, then remove from the oven to cool.\n\n* * *\n\n- Put the kombu in a blender with the other seasoning ingredients and blitz until fine, then tip into a bowl.\n- Cut the corn cobs in half crossways, and then in quarter lengthways, so that from each cob you get eight pieces.\n- Fill a pan no more than a third full with oil and heat to 175C or until a cube of bread browns in 40 seconds. Add the corn ribs, in batches, and fry for 6-7 mins or until they curl and the outer kernels start to colour. Remove from the pan and drain well on kitchen paper.\n- Sprinkle generously with the seasoning. Finish with chopped coriander, a little drizzle of olive oil and a generous squeeze of lime juice.",
