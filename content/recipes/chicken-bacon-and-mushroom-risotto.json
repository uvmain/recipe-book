  "instructions": "- Bring the stock to the boil in a saucepan over high heat. Cover, reduce to low and keep hot.\n\n- Use a little oil in a deep pan large enough to hold all the risotto, fry the chicken chunks for 6-7 minutes until lightly golden and cooked through. Remove the chicken and set aside for later. Repeat for 2 minutes with the bacon.\n\n- Add the onion and thyme to the pan and cook for 5 minutes until softened but not browned.\n- Add the mushrooms and increase to high. Cook for 10 minutes, until the mushrroms are tender and all the mushroom juices have evaporated.\n- Reduce the heat to low, stir in the rice and add a ladleful of the stock. Bring to a simmer and stir until the stock has been absorbed, before adding another ladleful. Continue like this for 20-25 minutes, stirring frequently, until the rice is creamy and tender but still has a little bit of texture.\n- Stir the cooked chicken and bacon into the risotto with the lemon zest and parsley, and season to taste.",
