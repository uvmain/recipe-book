  "name": "Lamb and Butter Bean Casserole",
  "ingredients": "- 1.5kg lamb neck fillet, cut into cubes of around 4cm\n- sea salt and freshly ground black pepper\n- 3 tsp ground coriander\n- 100ml olive oil\n- 2 red onions, thinly sliced\n- 1/2 a red chilli, finely chopped\n- 1 heaped tbsp tomato purée\n- 250ml white wine\n- 1 litre good chicken stock\n- 450g cooked butter beans\n- zest of 1 large lemon\n- 1 clove of garlic, thinly sliced\n- 300g cherry tomatoes\n- 50g black Kalamata olives pitted\n- 70g caperberries, stalks removed, halved\n- 2 tbsp chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley\n",
  "instructions": "- Preheat the oven to 160°C/gas 3.\n- Season the lamb with salt, pepper and the coriander. Heat the oil in an ovenproof casserole (one that has a lid), then add the lamb and brown it all over.\n- Lower the heat and add the onions, chilli and tomato purée.\n- Continue to cook for 2-3 minutes, until the onions have softened slightly, then add the white wine and bubble up until reduced by half.\n- Add the stock and bring to the boil, then put the lid on the casserole and transfer it to the preheated oven.\n- Cook for about 2 hours, until the meat is soft and tender and gravy has thickened, then take the casserole out of the oven, put it back on the hob and bring to a simmer. If you need to thicken the gravy a little, let it bubble up and reduce for a few minutes before adding the beans. If not, add them straight away, along with the lemon zest, garlic, tomatoes, olives, caperberries and chopped parsley. Bring to a Simmer, then take off the heat and serve. ",
