  "ingredients": "- 735g plain flour\n- A pinch of salt\n- 530g butter\n- 3 eggs",
  "instructions": "- Sift the flour into a bowl and add the salt. Grate in the butter and mix with the tips of your fingers until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs, ensuring there are no lumps of butter in the mix.\n- Crack the eggs into a measuring hug, beat lightly and top up with cold water until you have 280ml. Pour this slowly into the flour and butter, mixing for a few seconds until the mixture forms a dough.\n- Don't overwork it, or the pastry will be tough. Divide into 2 roughly shaped balls, wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before using.\n- This pastry can be frozen until needed.",
