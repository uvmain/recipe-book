  "instructions": "- Preheat the oven to 170C\n- Put the cream, milk, garlic and thyme into a medium pan and bring to a simmer, then immediately remove from the heat, season and leave to stand and infuse while you prepare the vegetables.\n- With a mandoline or sharp knife, slice the vegetables very finely and keep them separate.\n- Start to layer up the vegetables in a deep baking dish, starting with potato.\n- Season, then spread with 3 tbsp of the milk and cream mixture. Next, add a layer of beetroot followed by 3 tbsp of the sauce and season, and then repeat with a layer of swede.\n- Continue until all the vegetables are used up, reserving enough potato to finish with as the last layer. Season again, pour any remaining liquid over the top.\n\n- Push the  vegetables down gently with your fingers to ensure all the layers are immersed, cover with a sheet of greaseproof paper and then some foil.\n- Prick a few holes with a knife or skewer to allow steam to escape during cooking.\n- Place the baking dish on a baing tray (to catch any overflow) and put into the pre-heated oven for 1 hour.\n- Remove the foil and continue to bake for 10 more minutes, until golden brown on top.\n\n- Remove from the oven and leave to settle for 5 minutes before serving.",
